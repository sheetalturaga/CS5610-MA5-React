    <h2><u>Quick Hummus Recipe</u></h2>
    
    <div>This recipe makes quick, tasty hummus, with no messing. 
        It has been adapted from a number of different recipes that I
        have read over the years.</div>
    <div>Hummus is a delicious thick paste used heavily in Greek and 
        Middle Eastern dishes. It is very tasty with salad, grilled
        meats and pitta breads.</div>
    <br>
    <strong>Ingredients:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1 can (400g) of chick peas (garbanzo beans)</li>
        <li>175g of Tahini</li>
        <li>6 sundried tomatoes</li>
        <li>Half a red pepper</li>
        <li>A pinch of cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 clove of garlic</li>
        <li>A dash of olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Instructions:</strong>
    <div>Remove the skin from the garlic, and chop coarsely Remove all the seeds and stalk from the pepper, and chop coarsely Add
    all the ingredients into a food processor Process all the ingredients into a paste If you want a coarse "chunky" hummus,
    process it for a short time If you want a smooth hummus, process it for a longer time.</div>
    &nbsp;
    <div>For a different flavour, you could try blending in a small measure of lemon and coriander, chili pepper, lime and
    chipotle, harissa and mint, or spinach and feta cheese. Experiment and see what works for you.</div>
    <br>
    <strong>Storage:</strong>
    <br>
    <div>Refrigerate the finished hummus in a sealed container. You should be able to use it for about a week after you've made
    it. If it starts to become fizzy, you should definitely discard it.</div>
    <br>
    <div>Hummus is suitable for freezing; you should thaw it and use it within a couple of months.</div>
